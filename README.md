# Archinstall
This is a personal automated Arch Installation script, changes may added.

## Notice!
This script aims for modularity so you'll have to do the networking, partitioning and mounting steps yourself.

## Usage:

Grab the script with:


```
curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DanteAKD/Archinstall/main/arch-install.sh
```

Then make it executable:

```
chmod +x arch-install.sh
```

Finally exec it:

```
./arch-install.sh
```
